# Welcome Traveler!

Heyo, i'm tye, it's nice to meet you. Well _kinda_ meeting, since i'm just text on a website. Hmm... Would this count as "time-travel"? Since these words are from a me in the past, so you're reading the thoughts that i've tip tapped onto the computer from some time in the not so distant past.

Anyway, back to the point (if there even is one). I hope you enjoy my website and perhaps even reading a bit about me and the things that i do!
